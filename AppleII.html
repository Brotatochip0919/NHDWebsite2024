        In the same year of 1977 another very successful computer launched right
        beside the PET, setting this company in stone and establishing them into
        the world of computing and technology. Now with a case, keyboard and the
        first computer to come with a color display the Apple II launched with
        massive success. The Apple II launched with the program VisiCalc which
        was a spreadsheet program that was now affordable and accessible and the
        application very much contributed towards the popularity and profit of
        the Apple II. Apple themselves claimed in April of 1977 that more people
        had chosen Apple II than all other personal computers combined.
        Businesses bought Apple II computers just for the VisiCalc program and
        by 1984 2 million Apple II computers were sold.

        invade the homes of many families warming up to the idea of owning a

        office and into the homes of many and pushed its advertising toward
        putting the Apple II into the houses of many. Claiming it could teach
        your children and even play your favorite game PONG. The Apple II
        pioneered the idea of owning a home computer and brought it into the
