      The year was 1977 and CES (Consumer Electronic Show) was showing off the
      most influential products to the age of home computers. Sitting on a white
      pedestal weighing 47 pounds was Commodoreâ€™s PET. Sitting atop the computer
      was a 9 inch blue and white monitor which showed it revolutionary
      graphics. A powerful 1 Mhz 6502 processor gave it the ability to handle
      complex equations, and lots of data for schools, businesses or even home
      use. Although the graphics were very simple even some games were made for
      the PET. The introduction of the PET was a massive leap in the computer
      world because even though there were home computers before the PET the PET
      made it financially available to many along with an actual leap in total
      processing power.

      Immediately the Commodore PET was a massive success, so much so that
      Commodore was not able to produce enough computers to match the demand for
      the PET. Commodore came off of calculators and filing cabinets and hit a
      massive success with their PET and they would continue to succeed more
      with their next computers the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64 with the 64
      being the most sold computer ever.
