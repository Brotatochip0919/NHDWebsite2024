    <p class="paragraph">
      The year was 1977 and CES (Consumer Electronic Show) was showing off the
      most influential products to the age of home computers. Sitting on a white
      pedestal weighing 47 pounds was Commodore’s PET. Not a giant 7ft tall
      brick of straight computer but a small compact box. Sitting atop that box
      was a 9 inch blue and white monitor which displayed the computer’s
      revolutionary graphics. A powerful 1 Mhz 6502 processor gave it the
      ability to handle complex equations, and lots of data for schools,
      businesses or even home use. Although the graphics were very simple even
      some games were made for the PET. The introduction of the PET was a
      massive leap in the computer world because even though there were home
      computers before the PET the PET made it financially available to many
      along with an actual leap in total processing power.

      Immediately the Commodore PET was a massive success, so much so that
      Commodore was not able to produce enough computers to match the demand for
      the PET. Though much of the world had a hard time adapting to the new
      system of processing. Many blog writers thought that this type of home
      computer was just a fad and that it would fade out, but as it can be seen
      they were very wrong. Commodore came off of calculators and filing
      cabinets and hit a massive success with their PET and they would continue
      to succeed more with their next computers the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64
      with the 64 being the most sold computer ever.
