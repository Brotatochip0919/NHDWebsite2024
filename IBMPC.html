        Just a few years later in 1981 IBM released their own personal computer
        literally called the IBM PC. Leading up to its launch was very skeptical
        as many advertisers didnâ€™t have samples and many people were left
        wondering why the IBM was so great.Even though the problematic release
        in the first year IBM generated one billion dollars in revenue from the
        IBM PC. In the second year of selling IBM was having 200,000 orders per
        month. The IBM PC was a massive success in the business world due to its
        price and the software support on the computer.

        After the initial jump in sales IBM worked hard for better software
        getting licenses from different software developers to provide programs
        to satisfy their customers. Having all these computers in the office
        exposed many who would otherwise not touch or use computers to the
        wonderful world of computing. Rather than seeing computers as a thing
        for hobbyists people began to see that as a great way to entertain and
        use for everyday life.
